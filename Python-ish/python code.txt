Q: How to convert input binary to text python?
	Ans example below:
		st = "hello world"
		''.join(format(ord(x), 'b') x in st) //return bit representation of "hello world"

Q: unicode vs ascii
	Ans Unicode is a superset of ASC, and the numbers 0-128 have the same meaning.

Q: What is ASCII?

%matplotlib inline
	:sets the backend of matplotlib to the 'inline' backend.
	:with this backend, the output of the plotting commands is displyed inline with frontend like the
	Jupyter notebook, directly below the code cell that produced it.
	:it is then stored in the notebook documents.
magic function
	:is function that can be called with a command line style syntax.
	there are 2 types of magic functions: line magics and cell magics
line magics
	:is prefixed with the % character and work much like OS cammand line calls
	:they get an arguemtn the rest of the line.
	:line magics acan return resutlts
Cell magics
	:are prefixed with a double %%.
	:they get an argument not only the rest of the line but also the lines below 
	it in a separate argument
OS module
	:provides a way of using os depende functionality
	:it allows user to interface with the underying operating system that Pythong is runing on
	eg Window, Mac or Linux
sys module
	:provides info about constants, functions, and methods of the Python interpreter.
lmdb (python)
	:is a type of database available in python
cat
	:show a file's content with no paging and stopping.
toBinary(var)
	:covert a string to binary
ord(c)
	:retur an interger representing the Unicode code point of the character (bytearray obj)

assert 
	:An expression is tested and if the rsult comes up false, and exception is raised
	eg assert i == value
help()
	:use in debugging to see iheritance of the class tree. Attribute taht the class inherite from. etc

__repr__(self)
	:use in class to print out the "code" representation of the class
	note: it is a Dunder methods (special method)

__str__(self)
	:use in class to print out the string representation of the class
	Note: it is a Dundle methods
	Note:__str__ is called before __repr__ if both are define.

shift + tap:

NOTE

Bytes, Bytearray Python
	:Python spuports a range of types to storre sequences. 
	:There are 6 sequence types: 
		:string, btye sequences (bytes obj), byte arrays( bytesarray objs), lists, tuples, and range objs.
	Bytes vs Bytesarray
		Bytes 
			>is an immutable sequence of small intergers in the range 0 <= x <256, print as ASCII characters when displayed
			>it has the same methos as Bytesarray		
		Bytesarray 
		 	>is an immutable sequence of small intergers in the range 0 <= x <256, print as ASCII characters when displayed

Export path command 
	:explicity use export has the same effect as implicitly use export because it is built in
		note: to force all variables to automatically export you must add set -a above all var you wish to have effect over
		note: set -a = set | set +a = unset
